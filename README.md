# ICMP-Traceroute-Implementation-using-python

This project implements an ICMP-based Traceroute utility in Python to analyze network paths to various global destinations. The code constructs ICMP Echo Request packets, modifies their TTL (Time-To-Live) values, and measures RTT (Round-Trip Time) for each hop until the destination is reached. Using raw sockets, it sends packets and captures ICMP responses, distinguishing between responses indicating successful delivery, time-exceeded errors, or unreachable destinations. The project computes statistics such as packet loss, minimum, maximum, and average RTT for each destination. Designed for accuracy and efficiency, the implementation targets IP addresses across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, providing network diagnostics and latency measurements for each region. The code is structured to provide clear feedback on each hop encountered and is suitable for network analysis and performance monitoring.
